<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    This homemade frozen yogurt recipe is truly easy to make and it's so delicious. It's a better choice than store-bought varieties, and it tastes wonderfully fresh.</p>
<h2>Ingredients </h2>

    <ul> 
<li>Greek yogurt:</li>
<li>Sweetener: I like to use honey because it's so delicious. You can use a granulated sweetener if you prefer</li> <li>    
</li>   <li> Vanilla extract: Use high-quality pure vanilla for the best results.</li>


     
    </ul>


    <ol> <h2>Steps</h2>

       <li><strong>Mix.</strong> You start by mixing the ingredients together. You can use a food processor, or simply do as I do in the video below and use a hand whisk.</li>
       <li><strong>Freeze.</strong> Now transfer the mixture to a 9-inch square glass baking dish, spreading it out evenly. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the freezer for 45 minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Stir.</strong> Remove the pan from the freezer. Use a rubber spatula to give the mixture a good stir. You especially want to stir the already-frozen edges into the still-soft center. Flatten back, cover, and continue freezing for 2 more hours, stirring every 30 minutes.</li>
<li><strong>Freeze some more.</strong> The yogurt should now have a soft-serve consistency. You can go ahead and enjoy it. I usually transfer it at this point to a smaller container (this makes scooping easier), cover it, and freeze it for one more hour to achieve a scoopable consistency</li>
<li><em>Enjoy</em></li>
</ol>
